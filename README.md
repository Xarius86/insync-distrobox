# insync-distrobox
Bash script to make a fedora container in distrobox and install Insync.

# To Install
Rename the container if needed in the source code. Then simply type in sh make-insync-container.sh at the command line.

Thanks to [aaylnx on the Insync forums](https://forums.insynchq.com/t/insync-as-flatpak-linux/9615/87?u=ebits21) for most of the basis of the script!
